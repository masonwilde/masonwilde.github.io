This is a long overdue blog for my various musings.

I am an OS and ML/AI Software Engineer with experience working in Cognitive Control Systems research, Search Algorithms, DevOps, and ChromeOS. In my spare time, I enjoy making small games and apps to solve various problems I come across in life.

I hope to flesh this site out with links to my projects, webapps, and other documentation.

I'll probably also add sections for other hobbies such as DnD, cooking, lifting, and hiking.
