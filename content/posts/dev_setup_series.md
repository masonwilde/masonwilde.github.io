# The Wilde Way

## [Inspiration](https://xkcd.com/927/)

Everyone has their own guides to set up a dev device, but many have what I see as "opinionated" inclusions. Languages, editors, dark/light, etc. It can be cumbersome to follow a guide and then realize that they set a weird setting you don't like. This guide is intended to cover the bare minimums that I think **EVERYONE** should have, then go into the options I've seen others set that many users may be unaware of.
