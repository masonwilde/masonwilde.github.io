# EDC2Bug v2 (2023)
Disclaimer: I'll only provide links to products I personally have in my system. I'm not sponsored by anyone, and I don't get any kickbacks. I'm just sharing what I use.

## Philosophy
I read a bunch of various posts about bug out and go bags, and it seems like everyone has their own theory on a hierarchy of survival needs. I of course, decided to come up with my own. I wanted to prioritize always having a good minimum set of supplies, but also being able to scale up to a full bug out bag if needed. I also enjoy tech, so this pack includes my general tech carry.

### What do I have?
My first thought is to layer my supplies based on what I have.

1. My body and mind
2. Phone + Wallet
3. Clothes
4. A backpack
5. My Car
6. My Home

Each layer assumes I have the previous, and include increasingly more supplies.

I always have my mind and body, and 99% of the time I have my phone and wallet. If I have clothes on, I hopefully have at least one pocket. If I have a backpack, I can carry more supplies. If I have my car, I can carry even more supplies and store a proper bug out bag. If I have my home, I can load my car with the max supplies.

### What do I need for survival?
My second thought is to layer my supplies based on what I need. My own hierarchy of needs (based on various others too numerous to list) is:

1. Air
2. Defense
3. Shelter
4. Fire
5. Navigation
6. Water
7. Food
8. Tech
9. Fun

My thought process is that I can make it 3 minutes without air, max, so that is priority number one. Next, in a situation with hostile people, I need a way to defend myself in the short term. Once those have been handled, in extreme environments, I need shelter and heat within 3 hours. If I can stabilize to that point, I can navigate to safety if possible. If not, I need to find water within 3 days and food within 3 weeks. Finally, I need to keep myself sane and entertained if my situation is going to last longer.

On top of these needs, it is also helpful to have some tools that make certain tasks easier, such as light, writing, sewing, and cordage.

## The Kits

### My Body and Mind
What if I'm stranded naked on a desert island? I need to be able to survive with nothing but my body and mind. This mostly comes down to knowledge. Take a first aid course, do a wilderness survival lesson. Figure out some basic foraging in your area and learn basic knots as well as how to make basic cordage from natural resources.
