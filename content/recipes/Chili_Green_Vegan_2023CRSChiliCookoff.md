## Steps
1. Preparation
    1. Seed/pit anaheims, poblanos, and bell peppers, coat in oil and roast at 450F for 15-20 minutes or until slightly blackened.
      1. Dice all the peppers after they cool (Can also dice before roasting, just be careful not to burn them).
    2. Finely mince normal mushrooms using a knife or food processor.
    3. Dice onion, serranos, and habaneros.
    4. Drain the jackfruit and boil in water until tender enough to "mash" into threads. Drain and set aside.
2. Base
    1. Saute onions, serranos, and habaneros in oil until translucent.
    2. Add minced mushrooms - saute until they release their liquid and start to brown.
    3. Chop and add garlic - saute until fragrant.
    4. Add cumin, paprika, garlic powder, and pepper - saute until fragrant and mixed.
    5. Add all to the slow cooker.
3. Adding the Broth
    1. Pour in beer and broth.
    2. Bring to a simmer.
4. Solids
    1. Add the jackfruit threads.
5. Low and Slow
    1. Set at a low temp and slow cook as long as desired. At least 4 hours on high or 8 on low.
6. Final touches
    1. Salt to taste.
    2. If you feel it's missing something, try adding a bit more lime juice or other acid before going too far with salt.
    3. If you want more savoriness or "meatiness", try a little more soy or something like MSG or mushroom powder.
7. Serve
